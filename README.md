# 📷 My Next Prime Lens

**Before spending a bunch of money on prime lenses, let's analyze your phone photos to discover your most used focal length!**

This tool helps photographers — especially mobile-first shooters — make smarter lens-buying decisions. Simply upload a batch of photos taken on your phone, and the app will extract focal length metadata, analyze the distribution, and recommend the top 3 focal lengths you naturally gravitate toward.
